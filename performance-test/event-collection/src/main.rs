//! xtrace implemented with x11rb.
//!
//! This example shows a capability of x11rb that is most likely not useful to many projects: You
//! can write a transparent "proxy" that intercepts X11 traffic.
//!
//! Specifically, this program accepts X11 clients on `DISPLAY=":4"` via TCP and connects them to
//! `DISPLAY=":0"` via a Unix stream. All traffic between the client and the server is forwarded
//! and additionally decoded.
//!
//! Plus, just because I wanted to do a simple experiment: All of this is written in `async`hronous
//! code using `smol` as the runtime.
//!
//!
//! # Structure of the code
//!
//! The main file sets up the listener and spawns a task for each connection. That task, called
//! `handle_client` handles everything concerning this one client.
//!
//! In the `forwarder` module, there is a generic utility function `forward_with_callback` that
//! forwards everything that is read from an `AsyncRead` to an `AsyncWrite`. A callback is called
//! on the data that is forwarded. The callback is used to decode and print the traffic.
//!
//! The `connection` module then chunks the traffic into X11 packets, i.e. it determines the length
//! of each packet that comes across. This requires some decoding of length fields, but no output
//! is generated. The code here also determines the types of packets (connection setup, requests,
//! replies, errors, and events).
//!
//! Finally, the code in the `connection_inner` actually decodes the packets. For each X11
//! connection, some state is kept:
//! - The number of requests the client already sent (sequence numbers). These numbers are needed
//!   to map replies to their corresponding requests.
//! - The X11 extensions that are known to be supported. This cache is filled from `QueryExtension`
//!   requests and replies that "fly by".
//! - A list of pending requests for which a reply is still expected.
//!
//! The code in `connection_inner` then handles decoding X11 packets, updating the state of the
//! connection, and generating output via `println!`.
